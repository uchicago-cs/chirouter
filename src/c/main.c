/*
 *  chirouter - A simple, testable IP router
 *
 *  main() function for the router
 *
 *  The chirouter executable accepts three command-line arguments:
 *
 *  -p PORT: Port on which chirouter will listen (default: 23320)
 *  -c FILE: If specified, will produce a pcapng capture file with all
 *           the Ethernet frames received/sent by the routers.
 *  -v: Be verbose. Can be repeated up to three times for extra verbosity.
 *
 *  The main() function takes care of processing these command-line
 *  arguments and launching the router processing code.
 *

/*
 * This project is based on the Simple Router assignment included in the
 * Mininet project (https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Simple-Router) which,
 * in turn, is based on a programming assignment developed at Stanford
 * (http://www.scs.stanford.edu/09au-cs144/lab/router.html)
 *
 * While most of the code for chirouter has been written from scratch, some
 * of the original Stanford code is still present in some places and, whenever
 * possible, we have tried to provide the exact attribution for such code.
 * Any omissions are not intentional and will be gladly corrected if
 * you contact us at borja@cs.uchicago.edu
