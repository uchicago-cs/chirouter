/*
 *  chirouter - A simple, testable IP router
 *
 *  This module contains the code that manages the ARP cache and
 *  the list of pending ARP requests.
 *
 *  Most importantly, this module defines a function chirouter_arp_process
 *  that is run as a separate thread, and which will wake up every second
 *  to purge stale entries in the ARP cache (entries that are more than 15 seconds
 *  old) and to traverse the list of pending ARP requests. For each pending
 *  request in the list, it will call chirouter_arp_process_pending_req,
 *  which must either re-send the pending ARP request or cancel the
 *  request and send ICMP Host Unreachable messages in reply to all
 *  the withheld frames.
 *
 */

/*
 * This project is based on the Simple Router assignment included in the
 * Mininet project (https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Simple-Router) which,
 * in turn, is based on a programming assignment developed at Stanford
 * (http://www.scs.stanford.edu/09au-cs144/lab/router.html)
 *
 * While most of the code for chirouter has been written from scratch, some
 * of the original Stanford code is still present in some places and, whenever
 * possible, we have tried to provide the exact attribution for such code.
 * Any omissions are not intentional and will be gladly corrected if
 * you contact us at borja@cs.uchicago.edu
